        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Stephen Hawking was a renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist, born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England. He studied physics at University College, Oxford, and went on to earn his PhD in cosmology at Cambridge University. In 1963, Hawking
            was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition that gradually paralyzed him. Despite this, he made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of black holes and the nature of the universe, including the theory of
            Hawking radiation. Hawking authored several influential books, most notably "A Brief History of Time, " which made complex scientific concepts accessible to the general public. His work earned him numerous awards and honors, including the
            CBE and various honorary degrees. Hawking passed away on March 14, 2018, leaving a profound legacy in both science and popular culture.</p>
